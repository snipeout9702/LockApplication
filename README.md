The application can be used in place of the built in lock screen for Windows (and linux via mono).

## Recomended Installation
### For Users

Download the "prebuilt" folder and run the .exe to run the application!

### For Developers

If you're a developer wanting to make changes to the program then click download zip or run the following in your terminal
`git clone https://github.com/snipeout9702/LockApplication.git`

## Changing the default password
In the applications "settings" folder, there is a passwords.txt file, the password that is required to unlock the computer (close the application). By default it is __123__!
